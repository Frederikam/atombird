# Atombird
Aims to be an online RSS and Atom feed reader.

## Functional goals:
* Accessible on phones and desktops
* Acts as a progressive webapp
* Use a flexible card view instead of a traditional list view

## Non-functional goals:
* Minimalism is key.
* Frontend should be relatively fast. Relies upon the light-weight lit-html rendering library.
* Ethical privacy practices.

## Tech stack
### Backend
* Kotlin – Like Java but better.
* Spring Boot – Dependency injection and automatic configuration.
* Spring Webflux – Reactive API endpoints.
* R2DBC and Spring Data – Reactive data access.
* ROME – For parsing feeds.

### Frontend
* Typescript – Like JavaScript but optionally typed.
* lit-html – Super lightweight templating.
* Navigo – For routing.
